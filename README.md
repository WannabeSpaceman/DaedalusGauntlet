# Daedalus Gauntlets
20-DOF Modular VR Gloves

This repo is still heavilty under development! While I've got the gove hardware up to an acceptable enough standard to consider publishing it, there's still a bunch of small tasks I need to get done in order to actually have things in a state people can use for themselves - this includes:

- Creating a part naming scheme that makes sense to aid in assembly, as the internal names are currently too convoluted
- Creating a set of multiple-length connecting parts, as the scalable hardware used for fitting things to the user's hands is currently keyed to my specific size
- Creating a BoM
- Creating assembly documentation
